# Debt Collection Task

This is a repo to host the interview task done within Bespoke.

## Improvements

In order to continue with my work, I would focus on a UX approach by optimising the menu further for mobile. Perhaps by integrating an off-canvas menu to allow for a more enguaging experience. I would also focus on perhaps integrating this into some sort of templating framework such as Handlebars in order to ease development later on as well as integrating Tailwind CSS as an added bonus. In addition, I would also integrate some sort of gulp task to handle the automatic optimisation of images.
